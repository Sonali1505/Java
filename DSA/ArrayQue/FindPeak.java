// Find a peak element which is not smaller than its neighbours
// The array can be traversed and the element whose neighbors are less than that element can be returned.
// Follow the below steps to Implement the idea: 

// If the first element is greater than the second or the last element is greater than the second last, print the respective element and terminate the program.
// Else traverse the array from the second index to the second last index i.e. 1 to N â€“ 1  
// If for an element array[i] is greater than both its neighbors, i.e., array[i] > =array[i-1]  and array[i] > =array[i+1] , then print that element and terminate.
// nput: array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}
// Output: 20
// Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20.

// Input: array[] = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}
// Output: 20 or 90
// Explanation: The element 20 has neighbors 10 and 15, both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbors 23 and 67.
